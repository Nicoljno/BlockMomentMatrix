# BlockMatrixHierarchy.jl

This repository contains code for implementing the **block-moment matrix semidefinite hierarchy**: a general algorithmic framework that maps a wide range of quantum correlation problems to a sequence of increasingly tight (and increasingly computationally demanding) semidefinite programs (SDPs). 

The implementation is showcased on five open problems in quantum information:

Problem1. **Entanglement witnessing from imperfect measurement devices**  
Problem2. **Certifying measurements from fidelity-constrained sources**  
Problem3. **Computing dimensionality in genuinely multipartite entangled states**  
Problem4. **Benchmarking dimensionality for state-preparation devices**  
Problem5. **Finding uncertainty relations for nearly anti-commuting observables**
